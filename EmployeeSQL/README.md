SQL Challenge

In this week's challenge I went through six different csv files and read it through SQL.

The Assignment was consistent of three parts.

Data Modeling:
    In this part I used my CSV files and made a diagram in QuickDBD app.

Data Engineering and Data Analysis:
    In these part I work through the tables and made two sql files. I put it in VS Code to make it readable.
    analysis_queries.sql
    table_schemata.sql






Help:
I got help from the class notes. I also searched YouTube and Google. I would say most of the help came from the lectures and activities and then some from YouTube and Google.
